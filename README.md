# Associate-degree-graduation-project
For my associate degree thesis, I developed a web-based application using Python and Flask that offers movie, book, and music recommendations to users based on their mood. The project included user registration/login and session management, recommendation logic, and a favorites list feature. I used JSON-based data management.
